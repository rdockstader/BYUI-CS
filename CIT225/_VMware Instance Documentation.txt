VMware Instance Documentation

The VMware requires that you download and install VMware Workstation for your PC or VMware Fusion for your Apple OS. 
    Some Microsoft Operating Systems disallow running this instance because it's 64-bit, and their motherboards don't
	support hyper-threading (which means they're not 64-bit enabled devices).
